Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that allows data to be recorded and stored across a network of computers in a secure, transparent, and immutable manner. 
In essence, it is a chain of blocks, where each block contains a list of transactions or data records, and each block is linked to the previous one through cryptographic hashes, forming a chain

so here I have done a blockchain implemetation with the POW(Proof of work) and the difficulty level wil automatically increases after mining 2 blocks or every 10 minutes
